In this week, I have imported necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. The dataset of water quality was loaded and examined for structure, shape, and statistics. I have checked for missing values, changed the date column into datetime format, and sorted the data based on ID and date for final analysis preparation.
